     *
     * * into an empty block (e.g. an empty paragraph),

     * if they decided to put their image there.
     *
     * See the `ImageInlineEditing` for the similar integration that works in the opposite direction.
     *
     * The feature also sets image `width` and `height` attributes on paste.
