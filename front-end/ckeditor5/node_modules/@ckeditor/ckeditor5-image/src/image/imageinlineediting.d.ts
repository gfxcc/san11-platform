     * pasted or dropped. If such an image is pasted/dropped into a non-empty block
     * (e.g. a paragraph with some text) it gets converted into an inline image on the fly.
     *
     * We assume this is the user's intent if they decided to put their image there.
     *
     * **Note**: If a block image has a caption, it will not be converted to an inline image
     * to avoid the confusion. Captions are added on purpose and they should never be lost
     * in the clipboard pipeline.
     *
     * See the `ImageBlockEditing` for the similar integration that works in the opposite direction.
     *
     * The feature also sets image `width` and `height` attributes when pasting.
