 * The select all command.

 * It is used by the {@link module:select-all/selectallediting~SelectAllEditing select all editing feature} to handle
 * the <kbd>Ctrl/âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> keystroke.
 *
 * Executing this command changes the {@glink framework/architecture/editing-engine#model model}
 * selection so it contains the entire content of the editable root of the editor the selection is
 * {@link module:engine/model/selection~Selection#anchor anchored} in.
 *
 * If the selection was anchored in a {@glink tutorials/widgets/implementing-a-block-widget nested editable}
 * (e.g. a caption of an image), the new selection will contain its entire content. Successive executions of this command
 * will expand the selection to encompass more and more content up to the entire editable root of the editor.
