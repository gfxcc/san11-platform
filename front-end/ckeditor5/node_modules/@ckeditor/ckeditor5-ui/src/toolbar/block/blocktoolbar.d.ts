/**
 * The block toolbar plugin.
 *
 * This plugin provides a button positioned next to the block of content where the selection is anchored.
 * Upon clicking the button, a dropdown providing access to editor features shows up, as configured in
 * {@link module:core/editor/editorconfig~EditorConfig#blockToolbar}.
 *
 * By default, the button is displayed next to all elements marked in {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema}
 * as `$block` for which the toolbar provides at least one option.
 *
 * By default, the button is attached so its right boundary is touching the
 * {@link module:engine/view/editableelement~EditableElement}:
 *
 * ```
 *  __ |
 * |  ||  This is a block of content that the
 *  ¯¯ |  button is attached to. This is a
 *     |  block of content that the button is
 *     |  attached to.
 * ```
 *
 * The position of the button can be adjusted using the CSS `transform` property:
 *
 * ```css
 * .ck-block-toolbar-button {
 * 	transform: translateX( -10px );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 *  __   |
 * |  |  |  This is a block of content that the
 *  ¯¯   |  button is attached to. This is a
 *       |  block of content that the button is
 *       |  attached to.
 * ```
 *
 * **Note**: If you plan to run the editor in a right–to–left (RTL) language, keep in mind the button
 * will be attached to the **right** boundary of the editable area. In that case, make sure the
 * CSS position adjustment works properly by adding the following styles:
 *
 * ```css
 * .ck[dir="rtl"] .ck-block-toolbar-button {
 * 	transform: translateX( 10px );
 * }
 * ```
