/**
 * Provides the common contextual balloon for the editor.
 *
 * The role of this plugin is to unify the contextual balloons logic, simplify views management and help
 * avoid the unnecessary complexity of handling multiple {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/balloonpanelview~BalloonPanelView}
 * instances in the editor.
 *
 * This plugin allows for creating single or multiple panel stacks.
 *
 * Each stack may have multiple views, with the one on the top being visible. When the visible view is removed from the stack,
 * the previous view becomes visible.
 *
 * It might be useful to implement nested navigation in a balloon. For instance, a toolbar view may contain a link button.
 * When you click it, a link view (which lets you set the URL) is created and put on top of the toolbar view, so the link panel
 * is displayed. When you finish editing the link and close (remove) the link view, the toolbar view is visible again.
 *
 * However, there are cases when there are multiple independent balloons to be displayed, for instance, if the selection
 * is inside two inline comments at the same time. For such cases, you can create two independent panel stacks.
 * The contextual balloon plugin will create a navigation bar to let the users switch between these panel stacks using the "Next"
 * and "Previous" buttons.
 *
 * If there are no views in the current stack, the balloon panel will try to switch to the next stack. If there are no
 * panels in any stack, the balloon panel will be hidden.
 *
 * **Note**: To force the balloon panel to show only one view, even if there are other stacks, use the `singleViewMode=true` option
 * when {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/contextualballoon~ContextualBalloon#add adding} a view to a panel.
 *
 * From the implementation point of view, the contextual ballon plugin is reusing a single
 * {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/balloonpanelview~BalloonPanelView} instance to display multiple contextual balloon
 * panels in the editor. It also creates a special {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/contextualballoon~RotatorView rotator view},
 * used to manage multiple panel stacks. Rotator view is a child of the balloon panel view and the parent of the specific
 * view you want to display. If there is more than one panel stack to be displayed, the rotator view will add a
 * navigation bar. If there is only one stack, the rotator view is transparent (it does not add any UI elements).
