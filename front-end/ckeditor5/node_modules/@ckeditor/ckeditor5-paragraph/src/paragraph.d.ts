 *
 * * The {@link module:paragraph/paragraphcommand~ParagraphCommand `'paragraph'`} command that converts all
 * blocks in the model selection into paragraphs.
 * * The {@link module:paragraph/insertparagraphcommand~InsertParagraphCommand `'insertParagraph'`} command

     * Hence, if none of the features is going to convert those elements the above content will be automatically handled
     * by the paragraph feature and converted to:
     *
     * ```html
     * <p>Foo</p>
     * <p>X</p>
     * <p>Y</p>
     * <p>Z</p>

     * Note: The `<td>` containing two `<li>` elements was ignored as the innermost paragraph-like elements
     * have a priority upon conversion.
