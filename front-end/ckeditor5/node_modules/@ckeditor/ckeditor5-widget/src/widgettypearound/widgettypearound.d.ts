/**
 * A plugin that allows users to type around widgets where normally it is impossible to place the caret due
 * to limitations of web browsers. These "tight spots" occur, for instance, before (or after) a widget being
 * the first (or last) child of its parent or between two block widgets.
 *
 * This plugin extends the {@link module:widget/widget~Widget `Widget`} plugin and injects the user interface
 * with two buttons into each widget instance in the editor. Each of the buttons can be clicked by the
 * user if the widget is next to the "tight spot". Once clicked, a paragraph is created with the selection anchored
 * in it so that users can type (or insert content, paste, etc.) straight away.

     * 1. A user does one of the 2 scenarios described at the beginning.
     * 2. The "keydown" listener is executed and the decision is made whether to show or hide the fake caret.

     *    on which side of the widget it should appear.
     * 4. The selection dispatcher reacts to the selection attribute and sets CSS classes responsible for the
     *    fake caret on the view widget.
     * 5. If the fake caret should disappear, the selection attribute is removed and the dispatcher
     *    does the CSS class clean-up in the view.
     * 6. Additionally, `change:range` and `FocusTracker#isFocused` listeners also remove the selection
     *    attribute (the former also removes widget CSS classes).
