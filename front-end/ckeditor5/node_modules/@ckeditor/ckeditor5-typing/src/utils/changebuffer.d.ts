/**
 * Change buffer allows to group atomic changes (like characters that have been typed) into
 * {@link module:engine/model/batch~Batch batches}.
 *
 * Batches represent single undo steps, hence changes added to one single batch are undone together.
 *
 * The buffer has a configurable limit of atomic changes that it can accommodate. After the limit was
 * exceeded (see {@link ~ChangeBuffer#input}), a new batch is created in {@link ~ChangeBuffer#batch}.
 *
 * To use the change buffer you need to let it know about the number of changes that were added to the batch:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const buffer = new ChangeBuffer( model, LIMIT );
 *
 * // Later on in your feature:
 * buffer.batch.insert( pos, insertedCharacters );
 * buffer.input( insertedCharacters.length );
 * ```
